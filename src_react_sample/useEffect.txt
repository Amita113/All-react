The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects
in your components. Some examples of side effects are:
fetching data, directly updating the DOM,setting up 
event listeners,and timers.useEffect accepts two 
arguments.The second argument is optional.



How Does it Work?
useEffect accepts a function, and runs this function after every completed render. It also accepts an optional second argument, a dependency array. If a dependency array is passed in, React will know to re-run the effect only when values (state/props) inside the dependency array change. This hook also takes care of cleanup if required by the component.

By using this Hook, you tell React that your component
needs to do something after render. 
React will remember the function you passed 
(we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later
after performing the DOM updates.

Why we use fetch in useEffect?
The useEffect hook will make a network request on 
component render. When that fetch resolves, it will 
set the response from the server to the local state 
using the setState function. This, in turn, will 
cause the component to render so as to update the 
DOM with the data.



What are the three lifecycle methods of useEffect?
The React lifecycle: methods and hooks explained
useEffect works similarly to the three lifecycle 
methods: componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate , 
and componentWillUnmount 


setup: The function with your Effect’s logic. 
Your setup function may also optionally return a 
cleanup function. When your component is added to the 
DOM, React will run your setup function. 
After every re-render with changed dependencies, 
React will first run the cleanup function 
(if you provided it) with the old values, 
and then run your setup function with the new values. 
After your component is removed from the DOM, 
React will run your cleanup function.


useEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at 
the top level of your component or your own Hooks. 
You can’t call it inside loops or conditions.
